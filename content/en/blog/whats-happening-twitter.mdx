## Twitters New Policies

Twitter recently banned the account @elonjet after updating its policy on handling real-time tracking information. The account provided real-time tracking data on Elon Musk's private jet. While this type of tracking is not new and is available on other public and free applications such as [Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/) and [ADSB Exchange](https://globe.adsbexchange.com/). Twitter's policy change was implemented due to concerns over safety and the possibility of targeted attacks and doxxing of user locations.

As a result of the policy change, many journalists have also been banned for attempting to link to or post information about @elonjet or any other real-time tracking information. This has led to tension between Elon Musk and journalists on the platform.

In addition to this, Twitter has also implemented restrictions on sharing links to other social media platforms, such as Mastodon, Facebook, and Instagram. Attempting to share a link to these platforms will prevent the tweet from being sent and will give the user a warning that the link may cause harm.

While posts made from Twitter's Support account on this policy change have been deleted and the official page was also removed it still can be viewed from the [web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218210921/https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/social-platforms-policy)

There has been speculation among some users that Twitter's user base may be declining as other platforms offer better solutions and a more welcoming environment. The recent restrictions on sharing links to other platforms may also prevent users from discovering new platforms beyond Twitter. While an official page was created with the intention of setting the rule in stone, it is possible that this move could be rolled back in the future thus why it was removed.
